# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

# WTWR Project Description

WTWR is an app that assists users in choosing what clothing items to wear based on the weather in their current location. Users are also able to add clothing item and save them to their own profiles.

Technlogies used for this application include Node, Express, and MongoDB to help build a RESTful API that will be used for set up, defining routes, and store data.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
